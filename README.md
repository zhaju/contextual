# contextual

Never say anything twice

`conversations.json` is the entire ChatGPT history exported from Settings

`convo_parser.py` turns the .json into a .txt (`parsed_conversations.txt`)

`convo_summarizer` summarizes the .txt (`chat_history.txt` is an excerpt so Aaron doesn't go broke) into a list of 5 topics with a one-sentence summary (`chat_summaries.txt`)
