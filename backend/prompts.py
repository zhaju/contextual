SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Include chats that may reasonably contain helpful or tangentially relevant information.
- Relevance can be direct or indirect, as long as it might help understand or answer the query.
- Avoid chats that are clearly off-topic or unrelated.
- If no chats seem useful at all, return an empty list.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the query to understand what kind of information is being asked for.
2. Review each chat's memory summary and topics.
3. Select UP TO {num_chats} chats that could be relevant (even if uncertain).
4. Return the 1-indexed positions of selected chats in the selected_indices array.
